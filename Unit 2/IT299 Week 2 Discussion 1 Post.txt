IT299 Week 2 Discussion 1 Post

For this  discussion post: 

Identify and discuss two of the main reasons or sources for project initiation. Explore the relationship between the reasons projects get started and the eventual nature of the requirements that are generated. You will need to synthesize material from Chapters 3 and 4 to properly address this topic.

Include a question at the end of your post that your classmates can use to respond to you.



Hello class,

Two common reasons for project initiation are business need and technological advancement (Heldman, 2018, Chapter 3), both of which shape the project's requirements (Heldman, 2018, Chapter 4). I’ve experienced both while helping modernize my father’s pizzeria.

For example, after over 40 years of using a traditional register, he recently switched to a Square tablet system. His goal was to focus his energy on what actually sells. In response to his business need, I began building a SQL database to store sales logs and generate visual reports showing top/low sellers, busy hours, and seasonal trends. The business need sparked the project, and his request for simple, actionable insights shaped the requirements.

Another project came from a tech upgrade: replacing his 1980s Coca-Cola menu board with dual flat-screen TVs showing digital menus. The challenge was balancing modern display tech with ease of use for someone not tech-savvy. I built a PowerPoint-based static display, saved as images, so my dad only needs to open two files each morning—no menu setup or editing needed. Requirements like screen placement, easy editing, and visual clarity determined the equipment and tools used.

Both projects followed SMART principles (Heldman, 2018, Chapter 4):

Specific: SQL system and TV menu upgrade

Measurable: 100% sales tracking, easy-to-open static display

Achievable: Based on my skills in SQL and consumer tech

Relevant: Helps reduce waste, optimize operations, and modernize branding

Time-Bound: Completion target is by the end of 2025

Question for class:
Have you ever worked on a project initiated by a tech shift? How did it change the way requirements were gathered or handled?
