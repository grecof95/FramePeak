Hello class,

Building the project schedule becomes much easier when you've already completed key planning items like the Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), task dependencies, and resource availability analysis. For my project, having a well-organized WBS has helped clarify what needs to be done and in what order, making it much easier to estimate realistic timelines for each task.

The checklist of project processes is a helpful reference because it forces you to slow down and confirm that nothing has been skipped. It also reminds me to account for influences like risk assessment, clearly defined deliverables, and accurate duration estimation so they don't give me uneventful surprises later on in my project. 

From my experience so far, the more time I put into planning, the fewer surprises show up during execution. Specifically it has helped in my database schema design and how the data will interact with it. Having the checklist nearby acts as a safety net to catch anything I might have missed.

Question for classmates:
What’s one item from the planning checklist that you initially overlooked but later realized was more important than expected?

Hello class,

Thinking about risks early is essential for maintaining control over a project's schedule, budget, and outcomes. Techniques like brainstorming with stakeholders, reviewing similar past projects, or using formal risk checklists help uncover issues before they occur. Even if certain risks seem unlikely, the impact of being unprepared can be significant. Risk mitigation strategies such as avoidance or developing contingency plans can reduce these impacts. For example, building in buffer time or identifying backup resources helps manage common risks like delays or supply issues.

Using unfamiliar technologies can add unnecessary risks to quality, budget, and schedule. The learning curve can slow progress, increase labor costs, and lead to errors if team members aren’t trained properly. It’s important to account for training time and have mentors in place when implementing new tools. Proactively managing these risks helps ensure the technology improves the project rather than derails it.

Question for classmates:
Have you ever used a tool or technology in a project that increased risk, and how did you manage it?
