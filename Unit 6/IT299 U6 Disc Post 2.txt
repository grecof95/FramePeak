Unit 6 Discussion Topic 2 
Change Management

Identify the issues and discuss the processes that you could follow in relation to establishing an effective change management process for your project. How do changes "sneak" into projects? What are the difficulties in honestly communicating unplanned changes to project stakeholders? How should previously completed documentation be updated when changes to the project occur?

Include a question at the end of your post that your classmates can use to respond to you.

Hello class,

To the discussion topics point, one of the biggest challenges in project execution is managing change effectively. Keeping a defined change management process prevents even small adjustments from snowballing into scope creep, budget overruns, and missed deadlines. Changes can often “sneak” into projects through casual conversations, last-minute requests, or when team members act on assumptions without formal approval.

To manage this, a solid change control process should include:

A formal request process for submitting proposed changes

Impact analysis on scope, time, cost, and resources by the involved parties that make those decisions

A review board or project manager approval step

Development of the change

Stakeholder communication before implementation including a review board or project manager approval step for deployment

Documentation updates including the project plan, requirements, and schedule baselines

When changes occur, all affected documents—especially the WBS, schedule, and scope statement—should be updated to reflect the new direction. This ensures everyone stays on the same page and avoids confusion down the line.

Question for classmates:
If you have experienced a situation where a change was made without going through a formal process, how did it affect the project?
