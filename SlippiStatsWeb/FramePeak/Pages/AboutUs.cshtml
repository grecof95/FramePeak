    <p>
        Hi, I’m <strong>Frank Greco</strong> — A software developer and data analyst with a passion for Super Smash Bros. Melee.
    </p>

    <p>
        Like many players, I spent a lot of time stuck in silver rank, unsure of what to work on. I knew I needed better tools to analyze my gameplay — not just for myself, but for everyone grinding their way up the ranks.
    </p>

    <p>
        That's why I built <strong>FramePeak</strong> — A platform designed to help players identify trends in their matches, focus on tough matchups, and improve using real data from their own gameplay.
    </p>

    <p>
        Whether you're aiming to level up or just love stats, I hope this tool helps you reach your next milestone.
    </p>
