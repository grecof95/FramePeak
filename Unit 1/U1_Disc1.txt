Gathering business requirements and analyzing them is important in IT because they can change the entire scope of the project you are working on. For example, right now I'm working on a full stack project at work that ties in data entry, saving data entry to a long term storage database, then creating a web application that allows for users to then access that data entered. I picked and presented this project because I was able to analyze that the business practice was isolating who could do these tasks and causing the task to be significantly more time consuming than it needed to be. Making these analyzations allowed me to come up with an idea of a web application that ties seamlessly into making the process easier, quicker, and more efficient. 

This analysis goes even further because now I need to identify in the business what parts of the previous way this process worked could be kept. As I consider what did work, it allows me to build an experience for the employees that can stay similar to what they know. This also defines key portions of the project that I do not need to idealize from scratch, as I can use those sections of the previous idea as a template for what I need to create in my web application. Business analysis and requirements can define project scopes like this example shows. 

Understanding business needs from a macro and micro level for the company and the users in the business will allow for easier idealization, construction, and application of beneficial projects within the company. This also leads to better communication and trust within the IT department which is something that can help further not only the IT employee's career but also instill trust in the IT department as a whole to provide new opportunities for the department.
